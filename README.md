# AWS-RAG-MITRE-ATTACK-UNSWNB15-MAPPER
The goal of this project is to build RAG-powered MITRE ATT&amp;CK Threat Detection System combining machine learning and LLMs to automatically map cybersecurity data to ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques.  The system analyses UNSW-NB15-formatted network logs and textual threat intelligence to identify and classify adversary behaviors.
